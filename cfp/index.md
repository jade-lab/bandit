## Workshop on Big Data Analysis and Illicit Trends - b&it (BANDIT)
IEEE Big Data 2025 | December 8–11, 2025 | Macau, China (Hybrid)

<br>

##  Overview:

The 2nd International Workshop on Big Data Analysis and Illicit Trends aims to bring together interdisciplinary research on how big data analytics can expose, understand, and counteract illicit and harmful behavior on the Surface, Deep, and Dark Web. While the internet has revolutionized communication and commerce, it also serves as a platform for misinformation, identity fraud, cybercrime, and illicit trade. This workshop focuses on advanced methods to mine data, detect criminal patterns, trace illicit financial flows, and assess the societal impacts of online risks, with a special focus on the combination of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). We welcome contributions that offer novel insights, tools, datasets, or frameworks to monitor, analyze, and respond to criminal behavior and misinformation online.

The workshop will be held in conjunction with [IEEE Big Data 2025](https://conferences.cis.um.edu.mo/ieeebigdata2025/), taking place in Macau, China, from December 8–11, 2025.

**This is a Hybrid event**, allowing for both in-person presentations and remote participation.
